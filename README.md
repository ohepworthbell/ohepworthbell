### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for stopping by. My name is Oliver Hepworth-Bell and I am a designer-turned-developer based in Hertfordshire. I primarily work with JavaScript on the front-end, though I also dabble in PHP and - less-often - Python. I am currently looking to learn Rust (for personal projects) and WebGL, as well as dabble in hardware programming (using a Raspberry Pi) ðŸŒ±

You can check out my full GitHub portfolio at [ohepworthbell.github.io](https://ohepworthbell.github.io/). Being a dedicated JS developer, the portfolio is - fittingly - entirely JS-free...
